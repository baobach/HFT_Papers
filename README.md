# Hight Frequency Trading(HFT) Papers

A curated list of Quantitative Finance papers.

Due to the increasing interest in my project, I have updated the new format and address some issues with the first version. In this new version, I have updated the table format with brief descriptions and organized it in a separate folder which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/baobach/HFT_Papers/blob/main/hft_papers/papers.md).

Please reach out to me at robert@quantfin.net for any further questions. I will update this monthly and display the top 20 recent papers here.

| STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading | YILEI ZHAO et. al. | As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. | [arxiv-2412.09468](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468) | 2024-12-12 |
